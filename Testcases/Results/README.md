# Results
This folder contains the results of running [`AutoPatchSecondPass`](../LLVM%20Passes/AutoPatchSecondPass) on the CVEs dataset. For each CVE, the LLVM IR files (`.bc` and `.ll`) are present, along with the executable object files (`.o`) which can be run alongside the firmware (e.g., Zephyr OS).
