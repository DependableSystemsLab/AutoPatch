Note: 
(1) Double check that you generated the right patch.

// Solved: (By adding all the global variables)
(2) I added manually the global variables definition for compiling the bytecode to object file:
%struct.CBW = type { i32, i32, i32, i8, i8, i8, [16 x i8] }
@cbw = internal global %struct.CBW zeroinitializer, align 4, !dbg !0
@memory_size = internal global i32 0, align 4, !dbg !31
*Find how can we get these informations and add it to the generated file automatically.


(3) We should correct the second pass for storing the variables from stack into the global variables
For now, I commented the instructions that RapidPatch also didn't consoider them for generating the patch.

*Get the value for memory-size from the stack. (Like RapidPatch)
