# Testcases
This folder contains the testcases for the project. Each testcase is based on a real-world CVE. The CVEs are sorted by their year of publication and their CVE number. Each CVE folder contains the source `.c` file, the LLVM IR files (`.bc` and `.ll`). The `-inst` suffix on the LLVM IR files indicates that the file has been instrumented with AutoPatch passes. Finally, this is also the default location of the final executable object file.
