# Testcases
This folder contains the real-world CVEs dataset for evaluating the AutoPatch paper. The CVEs are sorted by their year of publication and their CVE number. Each CVE folder contains the source `.c` file, the LLVM IR files (`.bc` and `.ll`). The `-inst` suffix on the LLVM IR files indicates that the file has been instrumented with AutoPatch passes. The default location of the final executable object file is in the [`Results`](../Results/) folder.
