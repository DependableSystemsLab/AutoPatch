# AutoPatch Artifact

Welcome to the artifact for the CCS 2024 submission of our paper, titled "AutoPatch: Automated Generation of Hotpatches for Real-Time Embedded Devices". 

This artifact includes the implementation of *AutoPatch* and the source code of its LLVM passes. 
To evaluate *AutoPatch* and obtain results similar to those presented in the paper, access to one of the following **three** boards is required: 

**nRF52840, STM32-F446RE, or ESP-WROOM32**

It is important to note that, as explained in the paper, the LLVM passes (i.e., **Instrumentation and Analysis components**) do not necessitate a board and can be executed on general-purpose computers. 

Although **AutoPatch** has been evaluated on different RTOSes and boards, in this artifact we explain its evaluation on the **nrf52840** board and **Zephyr OS**.

#### The structure of the artifact is as follows:

## How To Run AutoPatch on a Board

### Configure the working directory

- Install the following packages (any modern version):
  - cmake
  - ninja
  - J-Link
- Run the following script:  
```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install build-essential curl libcap-dev git libncurses5-dev python2-minimal python3-pip unzip libtcmalloc-minimal4 libgoogle-perftools-dev libsqlite3-dev doxygen ninja-build gcc g++ clang-9 llvm-9 llvm-9-dev llvm-9-tools autoconf  
```
- Download and install CMake 3.26.0 https://cmake.org/download/.

- Install Ninja build `sudo apt-get install ninja-build`.
  
### Download Software Applications

Download the following software applications:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Nordic Semiconductor SDK (full suite)](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nrf5-sdk)
- [ZephyrOS](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html)

### Configuring LLVM

Please check [LLVM Passes](Passes) folder.

### VSCode Extensions

Download the following VSCode extensions for ZephyrOS and Nordic Semiconductor (found in the VSCode extension marketplace):

- DeviceTree for the Zephyr Project
- Kconfig for the Zephyr Project
- nRF Connect for VSCode
- nRF Terminal

Note that these extensions are required to run on the nRF52840 board.

### Connecting Nordic Semiconductor ARM Board

Connect the Nordic Semiconductor ARM board (nRF52840-DK) to the desktop computer. If the board does not automatically show up, make sure you have installed J-Link.

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.zephyrproject.org/getting-started-with-nrf-connect-for-visual-studio-code/) to create a project, build, and flash example code onto the board.

### Run LLVM Passes Using Shell Scripts

To streamline development work, we have written [scripts](Scripts) for executing the instrumentation and analysis components of AutoPatch.  

Before running the scripts, make sure to:
- Change the file path constants within the shell scripts to match the local file structure.
- Set **LLVM_BUILD_DIR**.
- Choose a C program from the example CVEs in [Testcases](Testcases).

Run `instrument.sh` by passing the chosen C file to it, and then answer the questions in Terminal (e.g., line numbers of official patch). Note that if you use our testcases, you should answer **true** to the **Is it patched?**. Then, It will generate a `.bc` file, which contains the instrumented llvm IR (i.e., trampolines in different locations of function). 

For generating the hotpatch (a functional equivalent patch that can be generated by one of the inserted trampoline, use the generated `.bc` file from prior step to run `analysis.sh` to get the `.o` file (see [Scripts](Scripts)), which represents the patched executable, capable on running on the targeted hardware.


### Adding AutoPatch Worksapce

When you install Zephyr OS on your system according to [this link](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html), a new directory will be created (e.g., \~/zephyrproject). You need to copy the [AutoPatchMain](AutoPatchMain) folder to this directory: **~/zephyrproject/zephyr/samples/**. 



### Flash and Execute

To run the generated hotpatch on the board running Zephyr OS you need to do the following steps:

- Open AutoPatchMain project with VSCode.
- Add hotpatch object file (located in \~/AutoPatch/Testcases/CVE_Lists/Results/Hotpatch_CVE_{CVEid}.o) (see [Scripts](Scripts)) to AutoPatchMain source code folder (e.g., src/LocalPatches/) (see [AutoPatchMain Project](https://github.com/Moh3nsalehi/AutoPatchCode/tree/main/AutoPatchMain)).
- Change CMakeLists.txt (e.g., \~/zephyrproject/zephyr/samples/AutoPatchMain/) to add the hotpatch information.
  - add_library(myac_obj OBJECT `hotpatch directory in AutoPatchMain folder`)
  - target_sources(app PRIVATE `hotpatch directory in AutoPatchMain folder`)
-  Change `main` function in `main.c` file in the src folder. For the hotpatches we generated, you only need to call one of the 36 `test_c()` functions.
-  Use **nRF Connect** extention in VSCode to flash and execute AutoPatchMain project to the board.
    - Forward the result to a serial port to see printed messages in the terminal.
 

## How To Run AutoPatch on PC

If you do not have access to the mentioned boards, you will need to perform the previous steps a bit differently. In the following, we will explain how the hotpatch execution process differs from the previous part. For this part, we used Ubuntu 22.04. 

*Note that AutoPatch is implemented to run on board and this part of the implementations is completely simplified and written for only one CVE to show that the generated patches are executable.*
